# Program of PhotonBrno

[Making games with python using quantum concepts](https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/event/5111/.en), April 19, 2024, Brno, Czechia (as a part of Erasmus+ Teaching Mobility program)

1. Experiments with photon - open [Quantum Flytrap](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab) in a new tab/window

1. The photon experiments with Qiskit - open [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zouzkboSxe7RnQ_lmf027pMjrF71M0Fu?usp=sharing) in a new tab/window (_use a private window if you will not use a Google account_)

1. Mathematical explanations of photonic experiments - open [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MJEF14G4BVVzG4U92Tmk9FEqx6wSTqor?usp=sharing) in a new tab/window (_use a private window if you will not use a Google account_)

1. Design [a classical game](classical-game.md) together

5. Extend the game with quantum superposition - check the details [here](base-quantum-game.md)

1. Develop your version now and later

   - Feel free to publish your version and inform abuzer.yakaryilmaz [at] lu.lv about it. We will list them on our Github repo.
   - You may use https://itch.io/ or your own space for publishing your version.
   - We suggest you to provide a description of your game (with suitable tags) along with a demo video.
